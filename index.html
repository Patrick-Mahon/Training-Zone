	Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:
	Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it:
	</p>
<u>
	<li>	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </li>
	<li>	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
	<li>	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. </li>
	<li>	Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: </li>
	<li>	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
	<li>	Which one are you most on top of? </li>
	<li>	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </li>
	<li>	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
